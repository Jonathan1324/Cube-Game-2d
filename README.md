To control the player use 'WASD' and the arrow keys to move through walls and turn them to floors.
Press 'Escape' to open the menu, with 'w', 's' and the arrow keys you can change your option, press 'Space' to do your option.
Press 'e' to teleport to a random location.
I would recomment to put the 'game.jar' into an extra directory, because the save and load Buttons create/update/read only files in the same directory as the jar file.
